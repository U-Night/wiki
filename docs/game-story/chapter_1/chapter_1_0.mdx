# Chapter 1: Introduction

## The starting point

**Twenty-five years** have passed since the collapse. The societies formed by the few survivors have been converted into **clans following unique ideologies**. The world is now governed by the law of the strongest, the state of nature. All that matters is the survival of one's faction. No one seeks to rebuild the image of the past for the best of all. Except one person.

### Introducing Vigo

**Vigo, an inquisitive and resourceful 19-year-old**, has never known a world at peace. Only the testimonies of his elders have enabled him to understand that, before the discovery of Muta, the universe was synonymous with stability.
Having never known his biological parents, he was raised by a pacifist clan, led and protected by valiant soldiers of the old war. Until then, the situation was still conducive to a normal life, but winters became increasingly harsh and the spread of toxic gases in the air led to the **deaths of those who kept the community safe** from outside threats.
These losses plunge the clan into a perilous situation, exposing it to all external threats. As a result, many of the clan's members **deserted**.
Vigo knows that he can no longer count on the help of his deceased allies, and that he will have to survive and fight alone.

But at the same time, in the months following this change of life, he wonders about a **strange vision** that he has been having repeatedly.
He sees in his dreams a sense of escape from the apocalypse, an allegory of wealth, happiness, peace and stability. Something inexplicable, but something he can't help imagining every night. What if there was something magical that could fill the whole world, **bring an abundance of goods to the poorest**, and put an end to this savage era?
Although he imagines that people would think he's crazy, Vigo is convinced that there's some truth to it, that these repeated dreams are no coincidence, and even worse, that this “something” is calling him. It's as if he's the chosen one, as if a messenger has come to warn him that he must go and find this treasure...
And one fine evening, under a starry sky lit by a full moon, he meditates on his situation, which he considers unbearable and unjust. This strange fantasy worries him to the point of paranoia. Not only is Vigo convinced that the relic is only waiting for him, but he also wonders if the purpose of his presence in our world was linked to this mission.
Closing his eyes, the unimaginable happens: Vigo no longer imagines the dream - **he lives it, he is in it!** In the blink of an eye, his mind is transported to an idyllic reality.

It's then that the **_player_ takes control of the controls for the first time**, and moves through a luminous paradise, from which shimmering lights emanate.
The **first tutorial** phase teaches the basics of movement. The camera switches to gameplay view. Heading to my right, surveying the lands of this dreamlike space, he experiences violent hallucinations before catching sight of a glimmer in the sky, towards which he carelessly approaches.
Vigo has no idea where he is. To tell the truth, he's quite aware that he's in a dream, that it's all a figment of his imagination. But he struggles to pursue it and reach his goal.
