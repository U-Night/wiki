# Chapter 1 - Act 1: SkolaDraur's run away

Of course, **nobody seems to take it seriously**. On the face of it, it's utterly stupid to imagine such a thing, and perhaps we should resign ourselves to this affair in order to finally understand and accept that the world as it was will never exist again.
But Vigo is **stubborn**, and if there's one person he trusts, it's himself. It's a stab in the back for him to see that his allies no longer follow him, that they've reverted to being strangers who don't share his ideas.
So, in a fit of madness, he packs his belongings, equips himself with the bare essentials for survival, and **runs away in the middle of the night**.
