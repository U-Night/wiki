**2020**. With energy resources in crisis, mankind is looking for solutions to meet its needs. This boom in scientific study leads to the discovery of an unusual element. Researchers were so interested that they examined it directly. The molecule derived from fluids, then called **_“Gel M”_** or **_“Muta”_**, is endowed with high energy potential.
Very quickly, it became part of everyday society life. Some exploited it with the initial aim of preventing resource shortages, while others became addicted to it. Gel M is a brand-new drug, with illegal trafficking increasing daily. Very quickly, it revealed its unique **mutagenic capacities** on each individual, such as an increase in physical strength, a drop in body temperature - making the population more resistant to heat - as well as various bodily deformations.
This resource is coveted worldwide, and **tensions are rising** on all sides of the globe to appropriate this new wealth.
Countries close in, rulers conduct military operations, while citizens resort to violence and treachery to obtain what is a new addiction.

In just a few months, the conflicts have turned into to a **full-scale world war**, with everyone fighting for their own cause. But one day, the point of no return is reached.
The major powers decide to take an action with disastrous consequences: the use of **nuclear weapons enhanced by a mutagen derivative**, increasing exponentially the destructive strength of these missiles.
With a sense of the end of the world, everyone destroys their neighbors to the point of causing their own death. The result is chaos, silence, hell on Earth: the end of humanity. And for many years to come, this silence continues.
**83%** of the world's population has disappeared, while **half** of the survivors have mutated as a result of the radioactive residues and dust in the air.
