## Who are we ? 
We're U-Night, a team of young and ambitious french student currently studying **Computer Science** at the Orsay's Institute of Technology.
We make this game because yes we're computer science students but first of all we're **gamers** that what drives us to make this game. We all love video games and we want to play one's part.
