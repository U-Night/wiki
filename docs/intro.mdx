## Who are we? 
We're **U-Night**, a team of young and ambitious french students currently studying **Computer Science** at the Orsay's Institute of Technology.
#### So, why this game?
Because we're computer science students but also, first and foremost, **purely passionate gamers**. That's what drives us to make this game. We love video games and everything they offer, from their mechanics to their art to their innovations. And we thrive on bringing our creativity to one of them.
